This project is aimed at providing a platform to help dog owners who are unable to walk their dogs and are looking for dog walking jobs. 
Dog walking volunteers can post information about themselves and their dog walking experience, as well as prices.
Dog owners can view the dog walker's information on the website, post their requirements, initiate a chat on the website, make a booking and pay on the website. 
At the end of each walk, dog owners can rate the dog walker. 
The site receives a commission from each transaction. Secondly, the site can partner with pet supply shops to place ads and earn advertising fees.
